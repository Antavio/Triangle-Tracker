# Triangle Tracker

## Author

### Project Description
This is a Triangle tracker program that allows a user to enter three Length values. The program then uses this values to determine the type of triangle formed. Depending on values entered, if all the values are equal it alerts that it is an equilateral triangle, if any two sides are exactly equal it alerts that it is an Isosceles triangle. Finally if none of the sides are equal & he sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side then it determines that the triangle is a scalene. Moreover if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side it indicates that the values cannot be used to form a triangle. Finally if the user enter values that are zero or less than zero the program will prompt them to enter values greater than zero.
